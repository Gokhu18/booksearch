# booksearch 0.1
A search-price Beautiful Soup-based webscraper for comparison shopping across multiple bookstores - mostly independents, but a couple larger outlets as well, just for comparison's sake.

Updates TK:

-Improvements to capdata code; more flexible & robust source needed.

-Search by ISBN number for further specificity (may incorporate Google Books API to do so)

-Boot to default web browser for immediate purchase

-Shipping cost calculation based on zip code(?)
