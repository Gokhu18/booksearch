# booksearch 0.1
A search and price comparison Beautiful Soup-based webscraper for book shopping across multiple stores - mostly independents, but a couple larger outlets as well, just for comparison's sake.

Updates TK:
-Improvements to capdata code; more flexible & robust source needed.
-Search by ISBN number for further specificity (may incorporate Google Books API to do so)
-Boot to default web browser for immediate purchase
-Shipping cost calculation based on zip code(?)
