# booksearch 0.1
A search-price Beautiful Soup-based webscraper for comparison shopping across multiple bookstores - mostly independents, but a couple larger outlets as well.

Updates TK:

* Improvements to capdata code; more flexible & robust source needed.
* Refining search to only return first search result
* Search by ISBN number for far greater specificity (may incorporate Google Books API to do so)
* Streamlining of the multisearch function to pull sites from list, rather than having to run each individually
* Boot to default web browser for immediate purchase
* Shipping cost calculation based on zip code(?)
